Description: Jellyfin is a home media server.
 It is built on top of other popular open source technologies such as Service Stack, jQuery, jQuery mobile, and Mono. It features a REST-based api with built-in documentation to facilitate client development. We also have client libraries for our api to enable rapid development.
