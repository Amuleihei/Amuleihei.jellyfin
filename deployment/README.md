# Build scripts

All `build.sh` and `package.sh` scripts are for *nix platforms (or WSL on Windows 10).

After running both, check the `*/pkg-dist/` folders for the archives and packages.

`build_all.sh` will invoke every build and package script.
Use `collect_all.sh` to copy all artifact to one directory for easy uploading.
