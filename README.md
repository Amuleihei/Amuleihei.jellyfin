## About

The Jellyfin project was started as a result of Emby's decision to take their code closed-source, as well as various philosophical differences with the core developers. Jellyfin seeks to be the free software alternative to Emby and Plex to provide media management and streaming from a dedicated server to end-user devices.

Jellyfin is descended from Emby 3.5.2, ported to the .NET Core framework, and aims to contain build facilities for every platform.
